# Inventory App

This is a simple server-side rendered app made using express, pug, and mongodb. It was an assignemnt on the Odin Project and was meant for me to implement the basic backend concepts I learned. The ui is very simple and not styled. It's a grocery store where you can create, read, update, and delete your own categories of food. You can also perform CRUD operations on specific items.
